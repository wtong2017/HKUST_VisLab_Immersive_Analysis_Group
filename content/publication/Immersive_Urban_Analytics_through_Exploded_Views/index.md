abstract: "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development and wide adoption of immersive head-mounted devices, such as HTC VIVE, Oculus Rift, and Microsoft HoloLens. These immersive devices have native support for displaying 3D models in an immersive environment. The capability has the potential to significantly extend the methodology of urban visual analytics by providing critical 3D context information and creating a sense of presence. However, 3D city models may cause severe occlusion problems, blocking the path toward enabling immersive urban analytics. This paper presents a novel technique to create an exploded view in immersive environments. The 3D models are firstly exploded and grouped into layers. Then we formulate and solve a nonlinear least squares optimization problem to ensure the visibility, compactness, and alignment of all layers. Different from existing methods, our method is tailored to analyze urban data in immersive environments. We further conduct experiments to compare our method with two different methods and exam our method in various situations based on the HoloLens platform."
