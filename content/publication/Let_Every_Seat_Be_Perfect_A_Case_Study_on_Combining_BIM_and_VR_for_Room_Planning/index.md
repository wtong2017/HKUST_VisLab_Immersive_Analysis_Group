abstract: "When communicating indoor room design, professional designers normally rely on software like Revit to export walk-through videos for their clients. However, a lack of in-situ experience restricts the ultimate users from evaluating the design and hence provides limited feedback, which may lead to a rework after actual construction. In this case study, we explore empowering end-users by exposing rich design details through a Virtual Reality (VR) application based on building an information model. Qualitative feedback in our user study shows promising results. We further discuss the benefits of the approach and opportunities for future research."
