Nowadays, data and information are generated anytime and anywhere. Effective data and information visualization facilitate people to make informative decisions. With the potential to become the next ubiquitous computing platform, Augmented Reality is a promising medium for people to access information. It can bring unique benefits, such as combining physical objects and abstract information/data and adapting display distances for different purposes.

At HKUST VisLab, we are devoted to enabling people to experience data and information visualizations in Augmented Reality. We have been exploring new visualization techniques, interactions, and authoring tools. Besides, we also plan to explore new applications for different domains in the future. If you have interests in our works, please feel free to contact us.
