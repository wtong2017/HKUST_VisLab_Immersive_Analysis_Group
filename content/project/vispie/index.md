  We build a digital twin of our living environments with gamification and
  advanced Augmented Reality (AR) techniques. Our demo takes place on a green
  campus. We define measurable activities and map each activity to reward points
  to gamify climate-related choices. For example, each time students use stairs
  rather than elevators, they earn climate points to exchange for virtual trees
  to be planted in the digital twin campus.


  They can explore the campus in both public displays and AR. The public displays show the overall digital campus, which lets students perceive how their behaviors influence the degree of greening on the virtual campus. AR provides students with an immersive experience to explore and observe the trees from the first-person perspective. The whole concept empowers students with higher awareness of climate-smart behavioral choices.


  We first obtain the buildings’ BIM model to implement the digital twin. Then, we adopt automatic (e.g., sensors) and manual (e.g., self-report) ways to track students’ activities with permission. Next, we develop a mobile AR app that allows students to plant and observe the trees on the digital campus.

ViePIE aims to promote a sustainable lifestyle with AR gamification and digital twin. We enable individuals to perceive the environmental implications of their measurable activities, immerse themselves in the climate change impacts, and empower both individuals and organizations with climate-smart choices.
